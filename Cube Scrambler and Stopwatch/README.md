A Rubik's Cube timer built in Python. The timer starts upon pressing of space-bar or clicking of Start button and can be stopped either by pressing space-bar or by clicking the Stop button. The timer automatically saves all the times in a text file. The Timer Window displays the last 12 solves, average of 5, average of 12, total mean, your best time, developer's best time and a 3x3 scramble with a button to change the scramble.

The Timer also congratulates you through a message box when you beat the developer's best.
